# Generative-AI-With-LLMs-by-Coursera
This repository contains Labs, Quizzes , PPTs and Notes for Generative AI With LLM offered by DeepLearing.AI and AWS.  

## Week 1

#### Generative AI use cases, project lifecycle, and model pre-training
##### Learning Objectives
- Discuss model pre-training and the value of continued pre-training vs fine-tuning
- Define the terms Generative AI, large language models, prompt, and describe the transformer architecture that powers LLMs
- Describe the steps in a typical LLM-based, generative AI model lifecycle and discuss the constraining factors that drive decisions at each step of model lifecycle
- Discuss computational challenges during model pre-training and determine how to efficiently reduce memory footprint
- Define the term scaling law and describe the laws that have been discovered for LLMs related to training dataset size, compute budget, inference requirements, and other factors.

## Week 2

#### Fine-tuning and evaluating large language models
##### Learning Objectives
- Describe how fine-tuning with instructions using prompt datasets can improve performance on one or more tasks
- Define catastrophic forgetting and explain techniques that can be used to overcome it
- Define the term Parameter-efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)
- Explain how PEFT decreases computational cost and overcomes catastrophic forgetting
- Explain how fine-tuning with instructions using prompt datasets can increase LLM performance on one or more tasks

## Week 3

#### Reinforcement learning and LLM-powered applications
##### Learning Objectives
- Describe how RLHF uses human feedback to improve the performance and alignment of large language models
- Explain how data gathered from human labelers is used to train a reward model for RLHF
- Define chain-of-thought prompting and describe how it can be used to improve LLMs reasoning and planning abilities
- Discuss the challenges that LLMs face with knowledge cut-offs, and explain how information retrieval and augmentation techniques can overcome these challenges
